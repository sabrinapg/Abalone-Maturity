# Abalone Maturity Prediction Project

Overview
This project aims to predict the maturity of Abalone using physical measurements. Accurate maturity prediction is essential for marine conservation and sustainable harvesting, particularly for endangered species like the White Abalone.

The dataset, from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, includes 4,177 entries with variables such as Length, Diameter, Height, and derived Age. The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis.

Methods
Various regression models were used to predict Abalone age:
- Linear Regression
- OLS Regression
- GLM (Generalized Linear Model)
- Logistic Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge and Lasso Regularization
- Tree-Based Models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

Key Findings
- Logistic Regression achieved 83.2% accuracy in age classification.
- Polynomial Regression excelled in capturing non-linear relationships.
- Gradient Boosting provided the best accuracy among tree-based models.

Conclusion
The project highlights the value of regression techniques in predicting Abalone maturity, offering critical insights for marine conservation and sustainable resource management.
